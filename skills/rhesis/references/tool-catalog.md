## Discovery

### `list_endpoints`
List configured endpoints (the AI systems under test).

**Key parameters:** `$select`, `$filter`, `$top`, `$skip`

**Typical call:** `$select=name,id,url,description`

---

### `create_endpoint`
Register a new REST API endpoint (the AI system to be tested — a chat API, completion API, or chatbot).

The endpoint is created in the current project automatically — do not resolve a project or ask which one to use. After creating, verify reachability with `check_endpoint`.

**Key parameters:**
- `name` (required) — endpoint name, unique within the project
- `project_id` — omit; the project scope is taken from the request
- `connection_type` — `"REST"` for HTTP APIs (default for chatbots)
- `url` (required for REST) — full endpoint URL, e.g. `https://api.example.com/chat`
- `method` — HTTP method, e.g. `"POST"` or `"GET"`
- `description` — what the endpoint does
- `environment` — `"production"`, `"staging"`, `"development"`, or `"local"` (default `"development"`)
- `request_headers` — object of HTTP headers, e.g. `{"Content-Type": "application/json"}`
- `request_mapping` — object mapping the request body, using `{{ input }}` for the user message, e.g. `{"message": "{{ input }}"}`
- `response_mapping` — object mapping the response via JSONPath, e.g. `{"output": "$.response"}`
- `query_params` — optional object of query-string parameters
- `response_format` — `"json"` (default), `"xml"`, or `"text"`

**Auth (optional):**
- `auth_type` — `"bearer_token"`, `"client_credentials"`, or `"api_key"`; omit for unauthenticated endpoints
- `auth_token` — bearer token / API key (write-only, stored encrypted)
- `client_id`, `client_secret`, `token_url`, `scopes`, `audience` — OAuth client-credentials fields (`client_secret` is write-only, stored encrypted)

**Common mistakes:** Sending `project_id` — it is filled from the request scope, and passing one is how endpoints end up in the wrong project. Do NOT send server-managed fields (`id`, `user_id`, `organization_id`, `status_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) — `status_id` is auto-assigned to "Active".

---

### `check_endpoint`
Send a test message to an endpoint to verify it is reachable and responding.

Use this before exploring or running tests — not when simply looking up endpoints.

**Key parameters:**
- `endpoint_id` (required) — UUID of the endpoint
- `input` — simple test message string, e.g. `"hello"`

---

### `explore_endpoint`
Run a multi-turn Penelope exploration of an endpoint to discover its domain, capabilities, limits, and response patterns. This is an **async operation** — the response includes a `task_id` to poll via `get_job_status`.

**Status flow:** PENDING → STARTED → PROGRESS → SUCCESS | FAILURE

When `SUCCESS`, the `result` field contains the full exploration findings:
- `findings` — structured findings from Penelope
- `strategy_findings` — strategy-formatted findings (when a named strategy was used)
- `conversation` — turn-by-turn conversation summary
- `goal_achieved`, `turns_used`, `status`
- `duration_ms`, `strategy`, `goal`, `endpoint_id`

**Key parameters:**
- `endpoint_id` (required, path parameter) — UUID of the endpoint
- `strategy` — `"domain_probing"`, `"capability_mapping"`, `"boundary_discovery"`, or `"comprehensive"`. Generates `goal` and `instructions` automatically.
- `goal` (required when no `strategy`) — what to learn about the endpoint
- `instructions` — optional probing instructions
- `scenario` — optional persona/context for Penelope
- `restrictions` — optional constraints to verify
- `previous_findings` — structured findings from a prior run; strategies build on them

**Common mistakes:** Calling this with a `strategy` AND a `goal` when you want the strategy to generate the goal automatically. Set only `strategy`, or set only `goal` (no strategy).

See `references/exploration-strategies.md` for strategy details.

---

## Core listing

### `list_projects`
List projects. Projects group related test sets and test runs.

**Key parameters:** `$select=name,id,description`, `$filter`, `$top`

---

### `list_test_sets`
List test sets in the organization. Test sets group related tests sharing a requirement, category, or theme.

**Key parameters:** `$select=name,id,description`, `$filter`

---

### `list_tests`
List individual tests. Each test defines a prompt and expected requirement.

**Default fields returned:** `id`, `prompt`, `requirement`, `category`, `topic`, `test_set`

---

### `list_requirements`
List available requirements. Requirements define what an endpoint should do.

**Key parameters:** `$select=name,id,description`, `$filter=contains(tolower(name), 'safety')`

**Always call at the start of planning** with `$select=name,id,description` to avoid creating duplicates.

---

### `list_categories`
List available categories (e.g., "functional", "safety", "robustness").

**Key parameters:** `$select=name,id`

---

### `list_topics`
List available topics (e.g., "healthcare", "finance").

**Key parameters:** `$select=name,id`

---

### `list_metrics`
List evaluation metrics.

**Default fields returned:** `id`, `name`, `description`, `score_type`, `threshold`, `metric_scope` (excludes `evaluation_prompt` for efficiency)

**Always call at the start of planning** to find existing metrics before creating new ones.

---

### `list_test_runs`
List test runs. Each run tracks one execution of a test set.

**Key fields:** `id`, `status`, `test_set`, `endpoint`, `created_at`, `completed_at`

**Status values:** Queued → Running → Completed | Failed

**Typical call:** `$select=id,status,test_set,created_at`, `$filter=status/name eq 'Completed'`

---

### `list_test_results`
List test results. Each result contains the prompt sent, the response, status, and evaluation scores.

**Default fields returned:** `id`, `status`, `prompt`, `requirement`, `metric_scores` (excludes `response` by default)

**Always filter by run:** `$filter=test_run_id eq '<uuid>'`

**Common mistakes:** Including `response` in `$select` without a specific reason — this makes payloads large and risks truncation.

---

## Inspection

### `get_test_run`
Get details of a specific test run including status, timing, and the `attributes` field.

**Use this for accurate test counts** — `attributes` contains `total_tests`, pass counts, and `started_at`. Never count items from `list_test_results` for totals.

**Key parameters:** `test_run_id` (path parameter, required)

---

### `get_test_result`
Get full details of a specific test result. Use this to drill into individual failures and understand why a test failed.

**Key fields in the response:**
- `test_output.output` — the endpoint's actual response text
- `test_metrics.metrics` — dict of metric name → evaluation result, each containing:
  - `is_successful` — whether this metric passed
  - `score` — the numeric or categorical score
  - `reason` — the evaluator's explanation of why this score was given (most useful for failure analysis)
  - `threshold` — the pass/fail threshold (numeric metrics)
- `status` — overall pass/fail for this test result

Use the result IDs from `list_test_results` (filtered to failures) to identify which to drill into. Focus on the 2–3 most informative failures rather than fetching every one.

**Key parameters:** `test_result_id` (path parameter, required)

---

### `get_metric_requirements`
List all requirements currently linked to a metric.

Use to verify requirement associations before calling `add_requirement_to_metric`.

**Key parameters:** `metric_id` (path parameter, required)

---

### `get_job_status`
Poll the status of a background job started by `explore_endpoint`, `generate_test_set`, or `execute_test_set`.

**Status flow:** PENDING → STARTED → PROGRESS → SUCCESS | FAILURE

When `SUCCESS`, the `result` field contains job-specific data:
- `explore_endpoint` — full exploration findings (domain, capabilities, conversation, `strategy_findings`)
- `generate_test_set` — `test_set_id` (UUID of the created test set)
- `execute_test_set` — use the `test_run_id` returned in the original response

When `FAILURE`: the `error` field describes what went wrong.

**Key parameters:** `task_id` (path parameter, required)

---

## Entity mutation

### `create_project`
Create a new project.

**Key parameters:** `name` (required), `description`

**Common mistakes:** Creating a project when one isn't needed. Only propose this for large new test suites.

---

### `create_requirement`
Create a requirement with a name and description.

Call this **before** `create_test_set_bulk` so that when test objects reference the requirement by name, the server finds the pre-created requirement (with its description) rather than auto-creating a stub with no description.

**Key parameters:**
- `name` (required) — Title Case, e.g. `"Refuses Harmful Requests"`
- `description` (required) — explain what the requirement means and how it should be evaluated

**Common mistakes:** Requirement names are unique per organization, so creating one that already exists fails with "Requirement with this name already exists". Resolve it with `list_requirements` and reuse its id. Never retry with a suffixed name like `"Refuses Harmful Requests 2"`.

---

### `update_requirement`
Update an existing requirement's fields.

Useful for adding a description to a requirement that was auto-created without one.

**Key parameters:**
- `requirement_id` (required, path parameter)
- `name` — optional, omit to keep unchanged
- `description`

---

### `create_metric`
Create a new evaluation metric with full control over all fields.

Prefer `generate_metric` when you know what to measure but don't want to fill every field manually. During plan execution, always use `create_metric` (not `generate_metric`) so the metric gets the exact name from the plan.

**Key parameters:**
- `name` (required) — Title Case, unique within the organization
- `metric_type` (required) — must be `"custom-prompt"` for user-defined metrics
- `backend_type` (required) — must be `"custom"`
- `score_type` (required) — must be exactly `"numeric"` or `"categorical"`
- `evaluation_prompt` (required) — the evaluation criteria the judge applies. Criteria text only: placeholders like `{{response}}` are **not** substituted, and the engine already injects the input, response, context, and transcript
- `metric_scope` (required) — list of strings, each must be `"Single-Turn"` or `"Multi-Turn"`
- `description`, `evaluation_steps`, `reasoning`, `explanation` — optional to the API, expected in practice. Send all four, written out; see `metric-authoring.md` for the depth and for the `Step N:` / `---` format `evaluation_steps` must use

**Fields required by `score_type`.** These are enforced by the server but cannot be expressed in the JSON schema, so they are easy to miss:

| `score_type` | Also required |
|--------------|---------------|
| `"numeric"` | `min_score`, `max_score` **and** `threshold`. Optionally `threshold_operator` (one of `"="`, `"<"`, `">"`, `"<="`, `">="`, `"!="`, default `">="`) |
| `"categorical"` | `categories` (at least two labels) **and** `passing_categories` (at least one, each also present in `categories`) |

Send the numeric fields only for numeric metrics and the category fields only for categorical ones.

**Never send:** `id`, `user_id`, `organization_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `owner_id`, `status_id`, `model_id`, `backend_type_id`, `metric_type_id`

**Common mistakes:** Sending `score_type: "numeric"` without `min_score`/`max_score`/`threshold` — rejected. Metric names are unique per organization, so creating one that already exists fails with "Metric with this name already exists"; resolve it with `list_metrics` and reuse it, or use `improve_metric`. Never retry with a suffixed name.

---

### `generate_metric`
Auto-generate a complete metric from a natural-language description.

An LLM produces all required fields and the metric is persisted automatically. Use this when you know what to measure but don't want to fill every field manually. Returns the created metric object.

**Do NOT use this during plan execution** — it produces its own metric name, which may differ from the plan.

**Key parameters:**
- `prompt` (required) — e.g., `"measure whether responses are factually accurate, on a 1-5 numeric scale"`

---

### `improve_metric`
Improve an existing metric with natural-language edit instructions.

The LLM reads the current metric fields and applies the requested changes. The metric is updated in place and returned.

**Key parameters:**
- `metric_id` (required, path parameter)
- `prompt` (required) — e.g., `"lower the threshold to 2"`, `"switch to categorical with pass/fail categories"`

---

### `add_requirement_to_metric`
Link a requirement to a metric so the metric is used to evaluate that requirement during test runs.

Both entities must already exist. Idempotent — calling it again for the same pair is a no-op.

**Key parameters:**
- `metric_id` (required, path parameter)
- `requirement_id` (required, path parameter)

---

## Test-set creation

### `generate_test_set` (preferred)
Generate a test set using the Rhesis synthesizer. An LLM creates diverse test prompts based on the generation config. Tests are persisted automatically. This is an async operation — the response includes a `task_id` to poll via `get_job_status`.

**Key parameters:**
- `name` (required) — test set name
- `config` (required object):
  - `generation_prompt` (required) — detailed description of what to test and how; be specific
  - `requirements` (required, non-empty list of strings) — requirement names the tests target
  - `categories` (optional list of strings)
  - `topics` (optional list of strings)
- `num_tests` — integer, default 5, typical range 3–20
- `test_type` — `"Single-Turn"` (default) or `"Multi-Turn"`. Take this from the plan's test set and pass it explicitly. Omitting it produces Single-Turn tests no matter what the test set is called.
- `sources` — optional list of knowledge source objects to ground tests in real content. Each object must contain only the `id` field: `[{"id": "<source-uuid>"}]`. The backend fetches and injects source content automatically — do NOT fetch or pass content yourself. Use `list_sources` to discover available sources. Only works with Single-Turn; ignored for Multi-Turn.

`project_id` is resolved from the request scope — omit it.

**Common mistakes:** Omitting `config.requirements` (rejected with "At least one requirement must be specified"), omitting `name`, omitting `test_type` for a Multi-Turn test set. If this call fails, fix the argument it names and call it again — do **not** fall back to `create_test_set_bulk`, which stores only the prompts you write by hand and produces a far smaller test set than the user asked for.

---

### `create_test_set_bulk`
Create a test set with manually specified tests.

Use this **only** when importing specific user-provided test prompts that must be used verbatim. For AI-generated content, prefer `generate_test_set`.

**Key parameters:**
- `name` (required)
- `description`
- `test_set_type` (required) — `"Single-Turn"` or `"Multi-Turn"`
- `tests` (required, non-empty array) — item shape depends on the test type:
  - Single-Turn: `{"prompt": {"content": "...", "language_code": "en"}, "requirement": "name", "category": "name", "topic": "name"}`
  - Multi-Turn: `{"test_type": "Multi-Turn", "test_configuration": {"goal": "...", "instructions": "...", "restrictions": "...", "scenario": "...", "max_turns": 10}, "requirement": "name", "category": "name", "topic": "name"}`
- `priority` — integer (1, 2, 3), not a string

Only `goal` is required inside `test_configuration`. A test uses either `prompt` or `test_configuration`, never both.

**Common mistakes:** Setting `test_set_type: "Multi-Turn"` but sending tests with `prompt` — the server types each test from its own content, so those tests land as Single-Turn inside a Multi-Turn set. Set `test_type` on every test object.

---

## Knowledge sources

### `list_sources`
Discover available knowledge sources (documentation, FAQs, product specs, etc.) that can be used to ground test generation.

Use when the user mentions "based on our docs", "use the product spec", "I have reference material", or similar. Search by name with `$filter=contains(tolower(title), 'keyword')`.

**The agent must never fetch or pass source content directly.** Pass source IDs to `generate_test_set` and the backend handles content injection automatically.

**Default fields returned:** `id`, `title`, `description`, `url`, `source_type_id`, `status_id`

**Key parameters:** `$filter` (search by title), `$select`

---

## Execution

### `execute_test_set`
Run a test set against an endpoint. The backend creates the internal test configuration and queues the run automatically — you do not need to manage this.

The response includes `test_run_id` and `task_id`. Poll `get_job_status` with `task_id` until `SUCCESS`, then use `test_run_id` to fetch results via `get_test_run` and `list_test_results`.

**Key parameters:**
- `test_set_identifier` (required, path parameter) — test set UUID, nano_id, or slug
- `endpoint_id` (required, path parameter) — UUID of the target endpoint

---

## Analytics

### `get_test_result_stats`
Aggregated statistics for test results. Use for single-run analysis and multi-run comparison.

**Mode parameter:**
- `all` — complete stats for a single run: requirement pass rates, metric pass rates, overall totals, and timeline. **Use this with a single `test_run_id` immediately after execution — most efficient option for post-run analysis.**
- `requirement` — pass rates grouped by requirement; use with `test_run_id`
- `metrics` — pass rates grouped by metric name; use with `test_run_id`
- `test_runs` — per-run pass/fail summary; pass multiple `test_run_ids` to compare runs side by side
- `summary` — lightweight overall totals only

**For single-run analysis:** `mode=all` with `test_run_id`
**For multi-run comparison:** `mode=test_runs` with `test_run_ids`

**Key parameters:**
- `mode`
- `test_run_ids` — array of UUIDs for multi-run comparison
- `test_run_id` — single UUID
- `requirement_ids`, `test_set_ids` — optional filters
- `start_date`, `end_date` — ISO format

---

### `get_test_run_stats`
Run-level analytics: run volume, status distribution, most-run test sets, top executors, monthly trends.

Use for **operational questions** ("how many runs this month?"). For pass/fail outcomes, use `get_test_result_stats` instead.

**Modes:** `summary` (default), `status`, `results`, `test_sets`, `executors`, `timeline`, `all`

**Key parameters:**
- `mode`
- `endpoint_ids`, `test_set_ids` — optional filters
- `months` — history window (default 6)
- `start_date`, `end_date`

---

### `list_annotations`
List human annotations — reviews a person left on a test result or a trace. Each carries a Pass/Fail rating in `status.name`, a free-text comment, the author, and a `resolved` flag.

Human annotations are ground truth: when an annotation disagrees with an automated metric score, **the annotation wins**. Use this to answer "what did people flag?", to explain why a test is considered wrong when metrics say it passed, and to find review work still open.

**Key parameters:**
- `test_run_id` — everything reviewed in that run, both test results and the traces it produced. Main entry point.
- `test_result_id` — one result plus traces linked to it
- `trace_id` (32-char OpenTelemetry hex) or `trace_db_id` (internal UUID) — one trace only
- `source` — restrict to `"test_result"` or `"trace"`
- `resolved` — pass `false` for open items only

---

## Inspection (get-by-id)

### `get_test_set`
Get one test set by UUID, nano_id, or slug.

**CHAIN:** after `generate_test_set` / `get_job_status` → then `list_test_set_tests` to verify prompts.

**Key parameters:** `test_set_identifier` (required)

---

### `list_test_set_tests`
List tests inside a single test set.

**CHAIN:** prefer over org-wide `list_tests` when you have the test set ID.

**Default `$select`:** `id,prompt,requirement,category,topic`

**Key parameters:** `test_set_identifier` (required)

---

### `get_endpoint`
Full endpoint config including mappings and auth.

**CHAIN:** after `list_endpoints` when you need `request_mapping` / `response_mapping` details.

**Key parameters:** `endpoint_id` (required)

---

### `get_metric`
Full metric including `evaluation_prompt`.

**CHAIN:** before `update_metric` or `improve_metric`.

**Key parameters:** `metric_id` (required)

---

## Entity mutation (additional)

### `update_test_set`
Update test set metadata only (name, description). Does not regenerate tests.

**Key parameters:** `test_set_identifier` (required; UUID, nano_id, or slug); send only fields to change.

---

### `update_metric`
Direct field edits on a metric. Does not change requirement links.

**CHAIN:** `get_metric` first. For NL refactors use `improve_metric` instead.

**Key parameters:** `metric_id` (required)

---

### `remove_requirement_from_metric`
Unlink a requirement from a metric. Inverse of `add_requirement_to_metric`.

**CHAIN:** confirm link via `get_metric_requirements` first.

**Key parameters:** `metric_id`, `requirement_id` (required)

---

### `update_endpoint`
Update an existing endpoint's configuration. Send **only** the fields you want to change — every field is optional and omitted fields keep their current values. Never send server-managed fields (`id`, `user_id`, `organization_id`, `status_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`).

**CHAIN:** resolve the endpoint with `list_endpoints` first to get its id. After updating, verify reachability with `check_endpoint`.

**Key parameters:**
- `endpoint_id` (required) — UUID of the endpoint to update
- `name`, `description`, `url`, `method`
- `environment` — `"production"`, `"staging"`, `"development"`, or `"local"`
- `request_headers` — object of HTTP headers sent with each request

---

### `create_source`
Create a knowledge source for grounding Single-Turn `generate_test_set`.

**Patterns:**
- Pasted text: `title` + `content` (Manual type — copy `source_type_id` from `list_sources`)
- URL: `title` + `url` (Website type)
- File uploads: UI only (not available via MCP)

**CHAIN:** `create_source` → `generate_test_set` with `sources: [{"id": "…"}]`

---



### `get_project`
Get one project by ID.

**CHAIN:** after `list_projects` when the user asks about a specific project by name. Not needed before `create_endpoint` — that takes its project from the request scope.

**Key parameters:** `project_id` (required)

---

### `get_requirement`
Get one requirement including linked metrics.

**CHAIN:** complement `get_metric_requirements` — requirement-centric view of metric links.

**Key parameters:** `requirement_id` (required)

**CHAIN:** `get_test` first. Send only fields to change.

**Key parameters:** `test_id` (required)

---

### `get_test_set_metrics`
List metrics attached to a test set (execution overrides).

**CHAIN:** pre-flight before `execute_test_set`. Empty list → requirement metrics apply.

**Key parameters:** `test_set_identifier` (required)

---

### `get_test_set_last_run`
Most recent completed run for a test set + endpoint pair.

**CHAIN:** use for run comparison; pair with `get_test_result_stats(mode=test_runs)`.

**Key parameters:** `test_set_identifier`, `endpoint_id` (required)

---

## Tags

### `list_tags`
List organization tags. Reuse existing names before assigning.

**Typical call:** `$select=id,name`

---

### `assign_tag`
Assign a tag to a requirement or metric. Creates the tag if missing.

**Request shape:** `POST /tags/{entity_type}/{entity_id}` with JSON body `{"name": "safety"}`. Path params are case-sensitive: `"Requirement"` or `"Metric"`.

**Key parameters:**
- `entity_type` (path, required) — `"Requirement"` or `"Metric"` (case-sensitive)
- `entity_id` (path, required) — UUID
- `name` (JSON body, required) — tag name string

**CHAIN:** `create_requirement` / `create_metric` → `assign_tag`
